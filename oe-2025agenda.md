# 🧪 Open Experiments 2025 — Agenda

**Logged on: July 11, 2025**

This is the live working agenda for the **Open Experiments** project.  
Its purpose is to track intellectual goals, upcoming actions, and evolving tools — across language, logic, cryptography, and system design.  
This agenda is a forward-looking guide — not a static record.

## 📆 Today's Agenda — July 11, 2025

### 🎯 Objectives
- Define and structure the concept of `predicate` in grammar and formal logic
- Investigate emotional and semantic challenges in understanding secrecy in encryption
- Frame encryption as a possible expressive or aesthetic form
- Launch this GitHub agenda as the center of project direction
- Write a working `index.html` for [www.open-experiments.org](https://www.open-experiments.org)

## 🧭 Fields Involved
- Linguistics (lexical semantics, pragmatics)
- Logic and Set Theory
- Cryptography and Secrecy Models
- Information Design and Web Publishing
- Systems Thinking / Architecture

## 🧱 Key Initiative for 2025

### 📌 The Open Group

- **Goal:** Learn about *The Open Group* standards (e.g., TOGAF)
- **Action:** Evaluate whether and how Open Experiments should adapt its structure to align with The Open Group’s frameworks
- **Note:** Organizational milestone established **July 2025**

Want me to save this into your GitHub-ready `oe-2025agenda.md` file directly, or prepare a commit-ready `.md` file for you to upload? I can also generate `index.html` as a minimal page with links to your agenda and negation PDF.
